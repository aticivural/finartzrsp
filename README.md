** fork project please **

for testing you can use POSTMAN, you can import test/finartzhw.postman_collection file to postman.

1. Refactor bad written code. (be careful for naming and formatting, use spring/java best practice)
2. Implement GameLogic class without using if/switch/(a ? '1' : '2') and you should remove 'firstWins' map. Use object oriented principles only.
3. Write unit and integration tests
